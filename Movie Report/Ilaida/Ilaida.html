          <div class="meaning meaning-1">
            <p>
              The main theme that stood out to me the most from the film was the
              <i
                >ability of machines to think like humans, as if imitating us,
                and ultimately surpassing us</i
              >. Alan Turing realized that trying all of the
              <i>159 million million million possible settings </i>on the Enigma
              Machine is a fruitless endeavor.
            </p>
            <div class="image-container container-1">
              <img src="images/vertical-2.jpg" alt="image-1" />
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="meaning meaning-2">
            <div class="image-container container-2">
              <img src="images/diagram.png" alt="diagram" />
            </div>
            <p>
              Realizing this, he immediately gave up on the idea of decrypting
              the daily Enigma settings. He instead opted for a
              <i>different solution</i>. A machine that could crack all of the
              possible settings in a rate that humans could only imagine.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="meaning meaning-3">
            <p>
              And the film portrays the struggle of manually decrypting the
              Enigma Code in a great manner. Showcasing the frustration of the
              decryption team at Bletchley Park. The frustration about their own
              powerlessness that results to
              <i>thousands of death in a daily basis.</i>

              There are many message all throughout the film but what struck me
              the most was near the ending of it, when they've finally cracked
              the code. Instead of celebrating the success of their labor, they
              were instead forced to burden a great deal of responsiblity.

          </div>

          <div class="meaning meaning-5">
            <p>
              Having broken the Enigma Code, they needed to keep it in secrecy
              as to not notify the Germans about it.
              <i>Saving a few thousand soldiers will not win them the war</i> if
              the Germans take notice of their sudden actions and changed the
              way they decrypt their messages.

              distraught about the idea of deciding who to sacrifice. But
              despite all that, they firmed their resolves to bring this war to
              a decisive conclusion.

              <i>"The Imitation Game"</i> is a captivating film that shows the
              life and achievements of Alan Turing. Benedict Cumberbatch
              delivered a compelling performance, bringing depth and complexity
              to Turing's character. The movie skillfully explores themes of the
              limitations of the human mind, identity, and the price of societal
              conformity. It sheds light on Turing's groundbreaking
              contributions to <i> computer science and cryptography</i>,
              highlighting the pivotal role he played in cracking the Enigma
              code during World War II.

              legacy of Alan Turing while raising important questions about
              society, identity, and the consequences of marginalization. It
              serves as a powerful reminder of the importance of recognizing and
              celebrating the diverse talents and contributions of individuals,
              even in the face of societal prejudice.

              I loved the way the war they redesigned <i>The Bombe</i> in the

              screams <i>mechanical ingenuity</i>. I loved the way the dials
              sound when it was rotated and the loud <i>clacking</i> sounds made
              it much more menacing in my opinion.
